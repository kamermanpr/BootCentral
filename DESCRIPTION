Description: Wrapper functions for "boot::boot", and "boot::boot.ci" to create a tidy dataframe of equi-tailed two-sided nonparametric confidence intervals [options: first order normal approximation, basic interval, studentized interval, percentile interval, and bias-adjusted accelerated interval (default)] for measures of central tendancy (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, median, mode) for numerical data. In addition confidence intervals for a difference in means and medians can be calculated if there is a two-level grouping variable. In the case of binomial categorical data, confidence intervals of proportions and odds ratios (in the presence of a two-level grouping variable) can be calculated. All functions play nicely with the "tidyverse".
